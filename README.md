## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tanvisharma31/CS-704_Deep-Reinforcement_Learning_Lab.git
   cd CS-704_Deep-Reinforcement_Learning_Lab
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Ensure that `requirements.txt` includes necessary packages such as `numpy`, `tensorflow`, `keras`, and others used in the project.

## Usage

### NumPy Basics

This section covers the basics of NumPy, which is a foundational library for numerical computations in Python.

1. **Explore the Basics:**

   Navigate to the `NumPy_Basics` folder and open the `NumPy_Basics.ipynb` notebook to understand fundamental NumPy operations and functions.

2. **Practice Assignments:**

   Go to the `NumPy_Practice_Assignment` folder and open `NumPy_Practice_Assignment.ipynb` to work on practice problems designed to reinforce your NumPy knowledge.

### MLP Models

The repository also includes implementations of Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models for various datasets. 

1. **Explore MLP Models:**

   You can find Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts for training and evaluating MLP models on datasets in the `MLP_Models` folder.

2. **Datasets:**

   - `Iris dataset`
   - `Breast cancer dataset`
   - `NASA Asteroid Classification Dataset`
   - `website-classification Dataset`
   - `Mobile Dataset`
   - `fetal-health-classification Dataset`
   - `fake-news-classification Dataset`
   - `cyberbullying-classification Dataset`
   - `crypto-currency-bitcoin-and-ethereum Dataset`
   - `Anameia prediction Dataset`

   Datasets are located in respective subfolders. Ensure that you have the datasets downloaded or accessible from the paths specified in the notebooks/scripts.

### Running Notebooks

To run the Jupyter notebooks, use the following command:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This will open a local server and allow you to interact with the notebooks in your browser.
