# Autoencoders and PCA for Dimensionality Reduction

This project demonstrates how to use **Autoencoders** and **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction on the MNIST dataset. The goal is to compare the performance of these two techniques by examining how well they can reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining its essential features.

## Project Overview

Dimensionality reduction is a powerful tool for feature extraction, noise reduction, and data compression. This project covers:
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: A traditional linear method for reducing dimensionality.
- **Autoencoders**: A neural network architecture that can learn non-linear transformations for effective dimensionality reduction.

## Files

- **Autoencoders_and_PCA.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook that includes data loading, model definitions, training processes, and evaluation for both PCA and Autoencoder methods.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, youâ€™ll need the following packages:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow`
- `keras`

Install the necessary packages using:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow keras
```

## Experiment Details

1. **Dataset**: The MNIST dataset is used for testing the dimensionality reduction methods. It contains grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9) with a size of 28x28 pixels.

2. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**:
   - We perform PCA to reduce the MNIST images to a lower-dimensional representation.
   - The reduced dimensions are then used to reconstruct the original images.
   
3. **Autoencoder**:
   - An autoencoder model is implemented with an encoder and decoder architecture.
   - The encoder compresses the input into a lower-dimensional space, and the decoder reconstructs the data from this compressed representation.
   
4. **Comparison**:
   - We evaluate both methods using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** between the original and reconstructed images.
   - Visualizations are provided to show the quality of reconstructed images for both PCA and Autoencoders.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download `Autoencoders_and_PCA.ipynb`.
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter or JupyterLab.
3. Run each cell to load data, build models, train the autoencoder, and compare the dimensionality reduction performance of PCA and Autoencoder.

## Results

The notebook includes visualizations of the reconstructed images and MSE scores to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each method. Generally:
- **PCA** is effective for linear feature extraction.
- **Autoencoders** handle non-linear features and may yield better reconstructions for complex data distributions.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential of both PCA and Autoencoders in dimensionality reduction tasks. Autoencoders are more flexible due to their ability to learn non-linear transformations, which can be beneficial for more complex data representations.
