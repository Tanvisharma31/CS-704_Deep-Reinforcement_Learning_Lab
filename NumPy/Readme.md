# NumPy Basics for Deep Learning

Welcome to the NumPy Basics for Deep Learning project! This repository contains resources and assignments to help you master the fundamental concepts of NumPy, which is a crucial library for numerical computations in Python, especially in the context of deep learning.

## Overview

NumPy is a powerful library that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. Understanding NumPy is essential for anyone working in data science and machine learning, as it forms the backbone of many scientific computing tasks.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

  - `NumPy_Basics.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook with explanations and examples of NumPy basics.
  - `NumPy_Practice_Assignment.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook with practice problems and solutions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To work with this repository, you'll need the following:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended for interactive notebooks)

You can install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy jupyter
```

### Usage

1. **Explore the Basics:**

   Start by navigating to the `NumPy_Basics.ipynb` notebook to get a comprehensive understanding of NumPy fundamentals.

2. **Practice Assignments:**

   Open `NumPy_Practice_Assignment.ipynb` to work through various practice problems designed to test and apply your knowledge of NumPy.

3. **Run the Notebooks:**

   You can open the Jupyter notebooks by running:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   This command will start a local server and open the Jupyter interface in your browser.

## Key Concepts Covered

- Array creation and manipulation
- Basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Array indexing and slicing
- Universal functions (ufuncs)
- Array aggregation and statistics
- Linear algebra operations
- Broadcasting

## Examples

### Array Creation

```python
import numpy as np

# Creating a 1D array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Creating a 2D array
arr2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])

# Array with zeros
zeros = np.zeros((2, 3))

# Array with ones
ones = np.ones((3, 2))
```

### Basic Operations

```python
# Addition
result = arr + 5

# Multiplication
result = arr * 2

# Slicing
sub_array = arr[1:4]
```
