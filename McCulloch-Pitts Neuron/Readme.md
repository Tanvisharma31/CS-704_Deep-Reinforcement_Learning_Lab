The McCulloch-Pitts Neuron is a simple model of a neuron that processes inputs and produces a binary output based on a set threshold. The model assumes that inputs are binary (0 or 1) and weights are fixed. The neuron computes a weighted sum of the inputs and compares it to a threshold to determine if it should "fire" (output 1) or not (output 0).

Here’s the basic formula for the neuron:

\[
y = \begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if} \sum w_i x_i \geq \theta \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

Where:
- \( x_i \) is the input value (either 0 or 1),
- \( w_i \) is the weight associated with the input,
- \( \theta \) is the threshold value,
- \( y \) is the output (either 0 or 1).

### Step-by-Step Implementation in Python

Let’s simulate the behavior of a McCulloch-Pitts Neuron for different inputs.

```python
import numpy as np

# Define the McCulloch-Pitts Neuron
class McCullochPittsNeuron:
    def __init__(self, weights, threshold):
        self.weights = np.array(weights)
        self.threshold = threshold

    def activate(self, inputs):
        # Calculate the weighted sum
        weighted_sum = np.dot(self.weights, inputs)
        # Apply the threshold to determine the output
        return 1 if weighted_sum >= self.threshold else 0

# Initialize neuron with given weights and threshold
weights = [1, 1, 1]  # Example weights for 3 inputs
threshold = 2  # Example threshold
neuron = McCullochPittsNeuron(weights, threshold)

# Define various input sets to test the neuron
inputs_list = [
    [0, 0, 0],  # Case 1: All inputs are 0
    [0, 0, 1],  # Case 2: Only one input is 1
    [1, 1, 0],  # Case 3: Two inputs are 1
    [1, 1, 1],  # Case 4: All inputs are 1
]

# Test the neuron with each set of inputs
for inputs in inputs_list:
    output = neuron.activate(inputs)
    print(f"Inputs: {inputs} => Output: {output}")
```

### Explanation:
- **Weights**: Each input has a corresponding weight. For simplicity, we use weights of `[1, 1, 1]`, but you can modify them as needed.
- **Threshold**: The threshold is the value that determines whether the neuron will "fire" or not. If the weighted sum of inputs is greater than or equal to the threshold, the neuron outputs `1`; otherwise, it outputs `0`.
- **Inputs**: Various combinations of inputs (0s and 1s) are tested.

### Example Output:
```
Inputs: [0, 0, 0] => Output: 0
Inputs: [0, 0, 1] => Output: 0
Inputs: [1, 1, 0] => Output: 1
Inputs: [1, 1, 1] => Output: 1
```

This shows how the McCulloch-Pitts Neuron responds to different inputs based on the threshold. You can change the weights, threshold, or inputs to observe different behaviors.
